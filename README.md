# infoVAE: Mutual Information in Variational Autoencoders

## Abstract

Motivated by the work of Chen et al. [1], we analyze the role of mutual information
in variational autoencoders. We experimentally study the behavior of this model
when mutual information between the latent code and the generated data is ex-
plicitly enforced as part of its loss function. Furthermore, we make an attempt to
formalize the role of MI in the VAE objective. We give an interpretation of a lower
bound to the MI as the reconstruction error of a dual VAE.
